# AI-Tic-Tac-Toe

This Tic Tac Toe game with AI powered by the minimax algorithm is a project I'm excited to share with you. I've coded this game from scratch to create a challenging and fun experience. The minimax algorithm allows the AI to think several steps ahead, making it a formidable opponent. It's a great way to test your strategic skills and improve your gameplay. Whether you want to study the algorithm, enhance your coding abilities, or simply enjoy a game of Tic Tac Toe against a worthy adversary, this project is a fantastic resource. Feel free to check out the code and contribute to its development, making it even more engaging and competitive.
